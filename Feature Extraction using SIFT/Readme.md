# Feature Extraction using SIFT (Scale Invariant-Feature Transform) 

The scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) is a computer vision algorithm to detect, describe, and match local features in images,


## Files Description

src folder contains two files
* real-time detection using SIFT
* keypoint feature matching using SIFT

res folder contains all the data required by the two files above and the ouputs.

> Experimentation

The real-time detection is only for experimentation, matching results are not always accurate with ISL sign language
